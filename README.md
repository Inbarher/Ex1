This project is the solution to Assignment 1 for a course at Ariel University.
It focuses on creating a program that works with numbers in bases 2 to 16, represented as strings in the format <number><b><base>.

The code can convert numbers between any base and decimal, compare values, and find the largest number in an array.
It also includes tests to ensure the functions work correctly and reliably.
